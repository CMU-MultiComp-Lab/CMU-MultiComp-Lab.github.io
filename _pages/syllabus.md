### Course Format

Lectures will be performed Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:20pm. Each lecture will focus on a specific
mathematical concept related to multimodal machine learning. These lectures will be given by the
course instructor, a guest lecturer or a TA.

**Canvas:** We will use CMU Canvas as a central hub for the course. From Canvas, you can access the
links to the live lectures (using Zoom). You can also connect to our course discussion platform
Piazza (see more details below) and the grading platform Gradescope directly from Canvas.
Quizzes will be done using Canvas as well.

**Zoom:** We will use the Zoom video platform for the live lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Links
to the live lectures will be available on Canvas. The lectures will also be recorded to allow students
to watch them again later. Please make sure that your Internet connection and equipment are set
up to use Zoom. During our class meetings, please keep your mic muted. If you have a question or
want to answer a question, please use the chat or the “raise hand” feature (available when the
participant list is pulled up). A TA will be monitoring these channels in order to share this
information with the instructor. All course lectures. will be audio/video recorded, to allow students
to watch asynchronously the lectures, if needed.

**Piazza:** We will be using Piazza for class communication and announcement. The system is highly
catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs and the instructor. Rather
than emailing questions to the teaching staff, you are encouraged to post your questions on
Piazza. You can post privately to the instructor and TAs through Piazza website. Piazza can be
accessed from the course Canvas page, or directly at this URL:

[https://piazza.com/cmu/fall2020/11777/home](https://piazza.com/cmu/fall2020/11777/home)

**Gradescope:** Students are asked to submit their project assignments through the website
Gradescope. This platform will be used for grading and to handle any request for re-grading.
Gradescope can be access from the course Canvas page.

### Project Assignments and Timeline

(See Piazza for additional information)
- **Dataset preferences** (Due on Tuesday 9/8 at 8pm ET) – Let us know your preferences for
the datasets that you would like to use for the course project. This will help with the team
matching process.
- **Project Pre-proposal** (Due on Wednesday 9/16 at 8pm ET) – You should have selected
your teammates, dataset, and task. Submit a 1-page pre-proposal plan.
- **First assignment** (Due on Friday 10/9 at 8pm ET) – This assignment focuses on unimodal
representations and requires a good literature review on the topic of your proposed project
- **Midterm assignment** (Due on Friday 11/12 at 8pm ET) – Students are asked to
implement and evaluate state-of-the-art baseline models on their project dataset.
- **Final assignment** (Due on Friday 12/11 at 8pm ET) – Students should explore new ideas
to model their multimodal research project.

### Grades

Remember: If you registered for this class, you have until November 9th to change your grade in
this course from a letter grade to a Pass/Fail grade.

- **Grading breakdown**
  - Lecture participation and mini-quizzes 15%
  - Reading assignments and question sets 15%
  - Course project assignments:
    - Project preferences and pre-proposal 5%
    - First project assignment and presentation 15%
    - Mid-term project assignment and presentation 20%
    - Final project assignment and presentation 30%

- **Lecture participation and mini-quizzes**
  - Lectures can be attended live (using Zoom) or watched later. Students are encouraged
to attend lectures live as often as possible, to allow them to ask live clarification
questions, if needed. Some lectures will also contain some live survey questions.
  - While watching the lecture (either live or recorded video), students are required to fill
a note-taking form and submit it within 42 hours from the end of the live lecture. For
example, if the lecture ended at 4:40pm ET on Tuesday, the note-taking form is due
Thursday at 10:40am ET.
  - Students need to use the provided online template for the note-taking form. This form
was designed for two main purposes: (1) train students for taking active notes during
lectures, and (2) offer students the opportunity to ask questions about the content of
the lectures.
    - The note-taking form will contain 4 sub-sections, one for each of the 20-
minute segments of the lecture (for a total of 1h20m).
    - For each sub-section, students are asked to either include a short statement
summarizing the main take-home message of the past 20 minutes, or write
down a question that student would like to get an answer about, related to
the past 20 minutes. Students should also include the slide numbers relevant
to the question/statement.
  - The student’s questions will be reviewed by TAs and instructor. The most popular
questions will be answered using Piazza, or with extra information during the following
lecture. Students are always welcome to post questions directly on Piazza at any time
if they would like clarifications or have a follow-up question.
  - These note-taking forms will not be required for the first week and for the
Thanksgiving week. Also, no forms are expected for weeks when a project assignment
(first, midterm or final) is due. We expect about 20 lectures where note-taking forms
need to be submitted.
  - Each submitted form will be graded for 1.0 point, with 0.25 point for each sub-section
of the form. The top 15 form will be kept for the lecture participation final grade,
worth 15 points.

- **Reading assignments**
  - Reading assignments are designed to complement the lectures and showcase recent
state-of-the-art research. Most reading assignments will consist of 2 or 3 research
papers, sometime accompanied of optional readings. The list of research papers will be
released at the latest on the Monday of each week.
  - To encourage exchange of ideas and knowledge between students, each student will
be part of one study group. A study group consist of 9-15 students. These groups will
be formed based on the project teams (see more details in next section about course
project). Each study group will consist of approximately 3-4 project teams together.
Each study group will have its own discussion forum to ask questions and share ideas.
  - For each reading assignment, each student is required to read only one research paper
(out of the 2 or 3 assigned paper). Students need to fill a summary form for the paper
they had to read and post the summary form before Friday 8pm ET. These summaries
will be shared with the other students in their study group. The goal is to write the
summaries so that other members in the study group can learn from it, and possibly
ask follow-up questions.
  - During the 7-day period of the reading assignment (Monday 8pm ET until the following
Monday 8pm ET), each student is required to post on the group’s forum at least once,
either a question or an answer. The question could be about the paper they are
currently reading, or about the other paper(s) that other group members are reading.
  - Reading assignments will be per released weekly, with exceptions when a project
assignment (first, midterm or final) is due the same week. Also, no reading
assignments during the first week and during Thanksgiving week.
    - We expect 10 reading assignments this semester.
  - Each reading assignment is worth 1.5 points: 1.0 point for the paper summary and 0.5
point for posting either a question or answer in the group’s forum.

- **Course project assignments**:
  - The goal of the course project is to experiment with state-of-the-art multimodal
algorithms and computational models.
  - Students should create teams between 3 to 5 students preferably (special approval will
be required for larger teams; no smaller teams will be allowed). The size and depth of
the project should be adjusted to reflect the size of the team.
  - Each team is required to create a code repository (github) for their project. All project
members should be included in this project and should actively use it. It is important
that all team members participate equally to the project. The first project assignment
and follow-up reports (midterm and final reports) will need to outline the tasks of each
student. If any team member has concern in the participation level of other members,
they should contact the instructor and/or TA as promptly as possible.
  - Students have flexibility in the selection of their project topic. The project should be
directly aligned with the course content and include at the minimum two modalities,
preferably language and vision. At the beginning of the semester, the instructor will
propose a set of research problems and datasets which can be used for the course
projects.
  - Pre-proposal: We ask students to prepare a pre-proposal early in the semester to
them establish their research topic for the course project. The pre-proposal will also
help with team formation, in the rare eventuality when students are still looking for
teammates.
  - First project assignment: The first project assignment consists of a written report and
an oral presentation (which will be performed remotely, with pre-recorded videos).
This assignment has two main goals: describe in more details the plan for the course
project (aka., “proposal”) and perform some unimodal analyses on the multimodal
dataset and problem. Feedback will be given by instructors as well as other students
from the course.
  - Midterm project assignment: The midterm project assignment is designed to
implement multimodal baseline models and perform some error analysis on these
results. This assignment also has two components: written report and oral
presentation. By the submission time for the midterm assignment, students should
have already implemented some of the state-of-the-art baseline models for their
selected multimodal task and dataset.
  - Final project assignment: Using the same dataset and task selected for the midterm
report, the final project assignment is designed to explore new research ideas. This
assignment is not graded based on the quality of the results, but instead on the
exploration of new ideas (e.g., better accuracy results will not mean better course
grade). Students are encouraged to explore new research directions. The final project
assignment also contains written and oral components.

#### Note about late submissions

In general, submitting assignments on time lets the instructional team provide feedback in a more
timely and efficient manner. Timely submissions are particularly important for assignments with
discussions and peer feedback, such as the reading assignments and the project assignments.
Since things happen, please contact me and the TAs as soon as possible (the best option is usually
via Piazza) if you are not able to submit your assignment in time. The default rule for the project
assignments will be that you are eligible for 90% of the grade the first 48 hours that the
assignment is late. For the reading assignments and course participation reports, late submissions
(up to 48 hours) will be deducted 0.5 point. If you must submit beyond 48 hours past the due date,
please contact me and the TAs as soon as possible so we can make arrangements.

#### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I
encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as
possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you 
suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet
registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at
[access@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:access@andrew.cmu.edu).

#### Statement on Student Wellness

This semester is unlike any other. We are all under a lot of stress and uncertainty at this time.
Attending Zoom classes all day can take its toll on our mental health. Make sure to move regularly,
eat well, and reach out to your support system or me [(morency@cs.cmu.edu)](mailto:morency@cs.cmu.edu)
if you need to. We can all benefit from support in times of stress, and this semester is no exception.

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as
strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating
and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your
academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services
are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health
services available on campus at: [http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/](http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/).
Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412-268-2922.

#### Diversity statement

**Every individual must be treated with respect.** The ways we are diverse are many and are
fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and an inclusive campus community. These
include but are not limited to: race, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation,
gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. We at
CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because it is necessary for
excellence and innovation, but because it is just. Therefore, while we are imperfect, we all need to
fully commit to work, both inside and outside of our classrooms to increase our commitment to
build and sustain a campus community that embraces these core values.

It is the responsibility of each of us to create a safer and more inclusive environment. Incidents of
bias or discrimination, whether intentional or unintentional in their occurrence, contribute to
creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. If you
experience or observe unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity, we encourage you to
speak out for justice and support in the moment and/or share your experience using the following
resources:

- Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: [csdi@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:csdi@andrew.cmu.edu),
(412) 268 2150, [http://www.cmu.edu/student-diversity](http://www.cmu.edu/student-diversity/).

- Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: [http://www.reportit.net](http://www.reportit.net)
username: tartans
password: plaid

All reports will be acknowledged, documented, and a determination will be made regarding a
course of action. All experiences shared will be used to transform the campus climate to be more
equitable and just.
